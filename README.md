# Hello-World
Exercise
Trying some commitment.
Not only with myself.
Learning the tecnologies that are changing the means of production and consumption.
Maybe i could collaborate in a way to end world hunger.
If we are an (meta)organism. We better start accting like one.
All cells in any organism get oxygen and food (glucose).
It is not a question o merit or deserving.
I hope i can help human kind to see that.
Thanks for your time.
